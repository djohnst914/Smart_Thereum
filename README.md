# Smart Thereum

For this project, I was tasked with creating an automated creation of a joint savings account by creating a Solidity smart contract that accepts two user addresses, the addresses control a joint savings account. The smart contract uses ether management functions to implement a financial institutionâ€™s requirements for providing the features of the joint savings account. These features consist of the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.
